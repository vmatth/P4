How to build files:

p4_ws:

Run "catkin_make" in the p4_ws directory

velodyne_plugin:

Run "cmake../" in the velodyne_plugin/build directory

Run "make" in same directory

Add the build & models directory path to the environment variable in .bashrc (hidden file in home)

export GAZEBO_PLUGIN_PATH=${GAZEBO_PLUGIN_PATH}:~/P4/velodyne_plugin/build
export GAZEBO_MODEL_PATH=$HOME/P4/velodyne_plugin/models:$GAZEBO_MODEL_PATH

(Your directory can be different depending on where the P4 folder is located)

How to build files:

p4_ws:

Run "catkin_make" in the p4_ws directory

Add the following to .bashrc (hidden file in home)

"cd P4" (Can be different depending on where P4 is located)
"source p4_ws/devel/setup.bash"

Try "roslaunch swarm_simulation simulation.launch" in new terminal

velodyne_plugin:

Run "cmake ../" in the velodyne_plugin/build directory

Run "make" in same directory (Edit: If it doesn't work, then "sudo apt-get install libignition-math2-dev")

Add the build & models directory path to the environment variable in .bashrc (hidden file in home)

export GAZEBO_PLUGIN_PATH=${GAZEBO_PLUGIN_PATH}:~/P4/velodyne_plugin/build
export GAZEBO_MODEL_PATH=$HOME/P4/velodyne_plugin/models:$GAZEBO_MODEL_PATH

(Your directory can be different depending on where the P4 folder is located)

To run the simulation:
Run "roslaunch swarm_simulation simulation.launch"
Run "rosrun swarm_simulation main_node" in a new terminal




## Probe signal test
<- main -> 
* Runs the test

<- plot_modeling ->
* Generates the plots used in report

## TOA and DOA implementation
### TOA implementation
<- threeChannelMAIN -> 
* Runs the test

### DOA implementation
<- ThreeMicrophoneV2-> 
* Runs the test
